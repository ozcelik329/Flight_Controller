## 🧪 Experimental Branch: RTOS & Multitasking Architecture
This branch is dedicated to transitioning the flight controller from a single-loop polling architecture to a **Preemptive Multitasking Model**. We are refactoring the codebase into isolated, high-reliability tasks.
The purpose of this branch is to experimentally add the following features without damaging the main branch:

* FreeRTOS integration[✅]
* PWM output via PIO (resetting servo jitter)[largely completed(✅)]
* sensor reading via DMA, watchdog timer[⏳]
* failsafe & heartbeat mechanism[❌]
* MAVLink parser (works even without zero, waits for serial port), and blackbox logger (via UART).[❌]
### 🚧 Implementation Challenges
* **MAVLink Parser:** Serial buffer yönetiminde "asynchronous fragment" hatalarını minimize etmek için dairesel tampon (ring buffer) boyutu optimize ediliyor.
* **Failsafe:** Watchdog timer'ın FreeRTOS `Task_Failsafe` ile çakışmaması için sistem `reset` mantığı üzerinde çalışılıyor.


### Core Task Structure
We are moving away from the "Main Loop" dependency by distributing critical flight operations into independent FreeRTOS tasks:

* **`Task_Control` (High Priority):** Handles the PID flight loop and sensor fusion. This task is strictly synchronized to prevent jitter.
* **`Task_Sensors` (DMA-driven):** Manages data acquisition from the IMU using DMA, eliminating CPU-bound I/O waits.
* **`Task_Comms` (Background):** Manages asynchronous MAVLink parsing and blackbox UART logging.
* **`Task_Failsafe` (System Guard):** A dedicated heartbeat monitor that triggers the watchdog or RTL protocol if any critical task fails to report within the specified interval.

Unlike the `main` branch, which relies on a procedural execution sequence, this branch experiments with **Concurrency**. By isolating these tasks, we ensure that:
1. Telemetry logging latency cannot affect PID loop timing.
2. Sensor read errors are contained within the `Task_Sensors` boundary.
3. The system remains reactive even under heavy computational load.
