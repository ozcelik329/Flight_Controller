# ✈️ AeroPico FC : Fixed-Wing Flight Controller

**AeroPico FC** is an open-source flight controller firmware for fixed-wing UAVs, built on the **RP2040 (Raspberry Pi Pico)**. It uses the chip's dual-core architecture to keep sensor fusion and flight control on separate cores — the same separation professional autopilots rely on, now accessible to everyone. 🚀

Whether you are a hobbyist building your first fixed-wing or a developer researching custom autopilot stacks, AeroPico FC gives you a clean, readable codebase you can actually understand and extend. 🛠️

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is currently in the **prototype phase** and is intended for educational and experimental use. It is not certified for commercial or safety-critical applications.

## 💡 Why AeroPico FC?

Most hobby-grade firmware is a black box. AeroPico FC is written to be readable first — every module has a single responsibility, every design decision is traceable in the code. You can start by tuning PID gains in `config.h` without touching anything else, and work your way down to the sensor fusion math when you are ready. 🧠

At the same time, the architecture does not cut corners. Dual-core task isolation, mutex-protected cross-core data sharing, a cascaded PID structure, and a hardware abstraction layer are patterns borrowed from professional embedded systems — not academic exercises. 💻

## ⚙️ Key Features

* ** Dual-core isolation** — Core 0 handles sensor reading and RC input; Core 1 runs the PID loop and drives servo outputs. They never block each other.
* ** Cascaded PID** — Outer angle loop feeds a target rate into the inner rate loop, giving smoother and more precise attitude control than a single-loop approach.
* ** Madgwick filter** — Efficient quaternion-based attitude estimation that works well even on resource-constrained hardware.
* ** MAVLink ready** — Telemetry layer is structured for MAVLink integration with any standard GCS.
* ** MPU6050 & GY-87 support** — Works with both a basic IMU and a 9-DOF module (with magnetometer).
* ** Configurable** — Pins, PID constants, RC ranges, and loop frequency are all in one place: `config.h`.
